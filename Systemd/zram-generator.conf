[zram0]
# The size of the zram device, as a function of MemTotal, both in MB.
# For example, if the machine has 1 GiB, and zram-size=ram/4,
# then the zram device will have 256 MiB.
# Fractions in the range 0.1â€“0.5 are recommended.
#
# The default is "min(ram / 2, 4096)".
zram-size = min(ram / 2, 4096)
